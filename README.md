A cozy sandbox game where you live life as a bear family in the forest… and try to survive the occasional hunters. 🐻🌲

I’m making this in Godot 4.6.1 and sharing the journey on YouTube:

If you want to see the development process (and probably a few mistakes along the way), feel free to check it out.

> Heads up: this is an early prototype. Things will change, break, and get improved over time.
