# BearHaven

A cozy sandbox game about building a life in the forest — and protecting it when danger arrives.

This is my current 2D project, built with Godot 4.6.1.  
I’ll be documenting the development on YouTube:

If you’d like to follow the journey (and all the inevitable dev struggles), feel free to check it out.

> This is currently an early concept prototype.  
> The scope may grow, shrink, or completely change as development continues.

## About The Game

**BearHaven** is a top-down sandbox game where you care for a family of bears living in a woodland sanctuary.

Build and expand your home.  
Decorate rooms.  
Farm crops.  
Explore the surrounding forest.

But every few days, hunters arrive.

Build defenses with your family, or fight the hunters as Papa Bear to defend your family from the horrors they bring.

The game focuses on balancing cozy family life with light survival tension.
